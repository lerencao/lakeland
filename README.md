## Lakeland

### Description

Lakeland is an almost word-by-word copycat of erlang library [Ranch](https://github.com/ninenines/ranch).
For now, this repo is just for the purpose of learning elixir and erlang.
Any sugguestion is appreciated.

Lakeland is an elixir mix project.
After cloning it, you can simply run `mix deps.get` and `mix compile`.
